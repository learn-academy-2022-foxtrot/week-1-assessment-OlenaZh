# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git is software which we use for version control.
GitHub is a cloud-based service.

Researched answer:
Git is a free version control system. The system allowed you to manage and keep track of your code.Since it is a software, it should be installed locally on the system. 
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that halps you manage your open-source progects, and keep your Git repositories organized. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: 
These operators will return a Boolean value:
&& - and,
|| - or 
== loose equal
=== strict equal

Researched answer:
The following operators will return a Boolean value:
 - The relational operators such as: 
== Equal to 
=== Strictly equal to
> Greater than
< Less than 
>= 
<=
- The logical operators such as:
&& AND (Returns a true value if both expression are true.)
|| OR (Returns a true value if either expression is true.)
! NOT (Reverses the value of the Boolean expression.)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:
Index is like an address of an element. It indicates a position of the element. 
Value is more like a data storage. 
Index is static. Every element has its index.
Value can be changed. For example, it can depend on wthat imput a user made. 

Researched answer:
Each element has its unique position, these positiond are called indexes. We can access the element using index. Knowing and using an index, we can get a value of the element. 
For ex.:
const myArray = [ 3, 5, 9, 4]
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++){
    console.log(myArray[i]) // we are saying here: "wherever the item is, give us its value".
}
Value. As a rule, when you declare a variable, you assign a value to it. It some kind of data. Value can be - numbers, text value -> called text string, value can be somth that has to be calculated or can be provided by user as an input.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer:
["this", "is", "an", "array"]
"this is a string

Arrey is a data structure.
String is an object. 

Researched answer:
Arrey is a data structure.
String is an object. 
Arrays are types of variable that can hold more than one value at a time. It can hold different data type. Ex.: ["hi", 25, true]
String can hold only char data type.
Arrays have a fixed length, strings - no



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
Pair programming means that you are working under the same task/code challeng in pair (you and your partner).
There are 2 roles in pair programmong:
- Navigator supervise, provide instructions, lead. 
- Driver (share screen, hands on a keyboard and write a code)
Pomodoro method:
- Decide on the task
- Set timer to 25 min
- Work on the task
- Take break
- Switch roles


Researched answer:
Pair programming is a technique in which two developers work on one computer/work on one task. But developers not only write code, they also plan and discuss their work. 
There are such roles as:
- Driver - writes code
- Navigator - reviews each line of code, lead driver, it is more "strategic" role. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: is a function that accepts function as parameters and/or returns a function

2. Jest: a JavaScript testing framework

3. Objects: are containers for named values called properties. Object can contain many values.

4. Method: are actions that can be performed on object.

5. Classes: are a template for creating objects. Use keyword class to create a class.
